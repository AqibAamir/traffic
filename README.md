This code simulates a traffic light and pedestrian crossing system with a GUI, integrating vehicle and pedestrian sensors, as well as emergency vehicle detection. The system uses threading to run continuous cycles for traffic lights and pedestrian crossings, adjusting timings based on detected conditions. The GUI allows user interaction for starting, stopping, and resetting the simulation, and includes additional controls like manual overrides and logging functionalities. Logs are maintained for events, errors, and sensor activations to monitor and debug the system's performance.

To run this code paste it into an ide and ensure the followign dependencies are installed
